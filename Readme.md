## Notes
- You can use any front end frameworks of choice
- pay close attention to the directory structure and add as many or little files as you require to them
- It is expected the form submission will call a random function that makes a call out to a web service. 
  The web service will be non existent so replace it with any stub/mock response.
- We wish to see your capaibilities in terms of developing maintainable code that follows good practices.
  The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your capabilities in the area.
